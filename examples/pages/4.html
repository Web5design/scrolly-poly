    <div class="post">What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne.</div>
    <div class="post">I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. Pound is tic-tac-toe right?</div>
    <div class="post">Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper.</div>
    <div class="post">I cheated and I lied and I whored around. You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! A million [bleep]ing diamonds! I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON.</div>
