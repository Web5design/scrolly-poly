    <div class="post">She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. The Army had half a day.</div>

    <div class="post">If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. A million [bleep]ing diamonds! Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways.</div>

    <div class="post">Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON.</div>

    <div class="post">See for more good stuff. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? Everybody dance NOW. Got a big ass room at the travelodge. What a fun, sexy time for you. Turn this skiff around! You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Also, your knee is on my heart.</div>
